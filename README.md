# ðŸ§© VSIX Downloader

A simple tool to download `.vsix` files directly from any Visual Studio Code extension URL.

## âš¡ Features

- Paste a VS Code extension link
- Click "Download"
- Instantly fetches the `.vsix` file from the Marketplace

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no install needed)
2. Paste the VS Code Marketplace extension URL (e.g., `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python`)
3. Hit the **Download** button
4. Done ðŸŽ‰ â€” your `.vsix` file will start downloading

## ðŸ§  Why This Exists

Sometimes you wanna sideload VS Code extensions offline â€” for example:

- Working in remote/dev containers where Marketplace isn't accessible
- Using VS Code forks (like VSCodium) that donâ€™t support the full Marketplace or lack certain extensions
- You just wanna stash a `.vsix` for backup or manual install

This tool makes it super easy without needing the VS Code CLI or Marketplace access from within the app.
